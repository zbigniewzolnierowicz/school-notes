        \subsection*{Task 8}
            The thought of travelling alone was a \textbf{daunting} prospect, so I signed up for an organised tour of the Amazon rainforest.
            I was apprehensive about the wildlife, but I assumed that the climate would be \textbf{bearable}.
            What I wasn't prepared for, however, was the \textbf{unbearable} humidity.
            The entire time I was there it was well over eighty percent and I was constantly uncomfortable and \textbf{sweaty}.
            It would have been \textbf{mindful} to check on the humidity beforehand --- I almost certainly would have gone somewhere else instead.

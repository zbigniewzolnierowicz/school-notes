\subsection{Task 5}
\begin{description}
    \item[pure feeling] sheer sense
    \item[surrounding sth] swirling around
    \item[watching with open mouths] gaping
    \item[many things happening at the same time] a flurry of
    \item[strongly emotional] visceral
    \item[filling sth] packing out
    \item[extreme] radical
    \item[reproduce sth] replicate
    \item[stopping themselves from breathing] holding one's breath
    \item[updated version] reboot
\end{description}
\subsection{Task 6}
It's not difficult to see why \emph{Stomp} has lasted so long. It's a show that's still {\bf packing out} theatres twenty-two years after it burst onto the scene in Brighton and \emph{Stomp} has lost none of its {\bf radical} power and raw energy. I first saw \emph{Stomp} at the age of ten and I remember {\bf gaping} at the attractive young performens with big dustbin lids transforming broms, oil  cans and vacuum cleaner tubes into musical instruments. In all these years, \emph{Stomp} has never undergone any {\bf radical} changes - there is no need for a major {\bf reboot} when the original format works so well. Other theatre troupes have tried to {\bf replicate} the \emph{Stomp} formula but none have stolen the crown from the original.
\subsection{Task 8}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I really enjoy {\bf percussive} music. The more rhythm the better.
    \item I hate it when the stage is crammed with {\bf props}. I can't focus on the acting then.
    \item I feel uneasy when an actor suddenly walks down the {\bf aisle} and starts interacting with the audience
    \item As a child I was frightened of clowns on {\bf stage}. They looked gigantic to me!
    \item I'm enthralled by the {\bf choral} singing of big groups of vocalists performing in unison
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Task 9}
\begin{description}
    \item[misguided] ill-judged
    \item[very exciting or frightening] heart-stopping
    \item[having continued for a long time] long-running
    \item[having a great influence or effect] far-reaching
    \item[having your mouth open because you are amazed] slack-jawed
    \item[earning the largest amount of money] highest-grossing
\end{description}
\subsection{Task 11}
\begin{description}
    \item[having good intentions] well-{\bf meaning}
    \item[very exciting, shocking or strange] mind-{\bf blowing}
    \item[unlikely or difficult to be] far-{\bf fetched}
    \item[full of exciting events] action-{\bf packed}
    \item[clever] quick-{\bf witted}
    \item[not liking to spend money] tight-{\bf fisted}

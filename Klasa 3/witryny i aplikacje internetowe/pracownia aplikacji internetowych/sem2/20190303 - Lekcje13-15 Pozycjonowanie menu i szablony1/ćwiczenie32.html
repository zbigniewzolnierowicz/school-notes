            <p>What a strange person. Bloody Peasant! I am your king. But you are dressed as one… Camelot!</p>
            <p>He hasn't got shit all over him. Look, my liege! Well, how'd you become king, then? Burn her anyway!</p>
            <p>Oh, ow! Well, what do you want? Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm
                being repressed! Shut up! Burn her!</p>
            <p>She looks like one. What do you mean? She looks like one. Look, my liege! It's only a model.</p>
            <p>Well, we did do the nose. Did you dress her up like this? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the
                purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine
                providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.</p>
            <p>Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. The
                swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in
                winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.</p>
            <p>Burn her anyway! Well, we did do the nose. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.
                But you are dressed as one… Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!</p>
            <p>Bloody Peasant! I am your king. Well, how'd you become king, then? Bloody Peasant! Shh! Knights, I bid
                you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Bloody Peasant!</p>

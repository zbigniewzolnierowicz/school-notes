    <h1>Well, she turned me into a newt.</h1>
    <p>Burn her anyway! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.
        It's only a model. You don't vote for kings. Well, what do you want?</p>
    <p>Well, she turned me into a newt. Burn her! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart
        threw a sword at you! Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! I have to push the pram a lot.</p>
    <h2>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!</h2>

        Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!</p>
    <p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the
        water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king. And
        this isn't my nose. This is a false one.</p>

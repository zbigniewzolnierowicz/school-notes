The people shown on this image might be a couple, given how close they are together and how they are looking into each other's eyes. Judging by their shoes, they must be professional dancers, as most shoes are very different depending on the person wearing them, but they both look the same, therefore the shoes must serve some function. They might have been dancing for a while as they are in mid-dance.

## Review

I have been using the KZ ZST headphones for a couple months now, and I honestly think that these are the best headphones for someone that isn't ready to give the headphone jack up yet but he has a phone without the port that we're so accustomed to.
KZ is a brand of the Shenzhen Yuan Ze Electronic Co. Ltd. manufacturer hailing from Shenzhen in China, and they have been making headphones for 5 years, since their inception in 2014. One of the main drives to these headphones is their amazing sound quality, budget price and most importantly, they have a feature that isn't available in budget headphones - an interchangeable cable.
KZ is the only company manufacturing in-ear headphones with such cables, because the only thing that comes to mind when thinking about wireless headphones with detachable headphones, it's usually huge, expensive, audiophile-grade cans, which are really uncomfortable to wear. The KZ ZST, on the other hand, is designed to be light, no matter which type of cable you want to use. Speaking of cables, KZ has a huge selection of these with different kinds of wireinside them. You can choose your run-of-the-mill cables with copper wiring or you could get the slightly more expensive ones that are silver-plated.
The two downside with those is that there are just too many different types of connectors for these headphones and none of them are standardized, as opposed to the headphones with interchangeable cables from other, more popular manufacturers which use the standard 3.5mm jack, but I understand why they've made that decision - were they to cram a headphone jack socket in those headphones they would lose on their ergonomics and ease of use. The other con is that these cables tend to unplug themselves after some use, which means that these sockets don't hold the plugs all that well.
As for the sound quality, I was honestly surprised. For such a low price, you get really good headphones that trump most of the competition. The sound doesn't even get tinny at higher volumes. Other than that, you might get turned off by the need to import them and the really hard to take advantage of warranty program, because you need to service the headphones in China.
This is a great gateway to the world of wireless headphones, a great coping tool for those not yet ready to give up the headphone jack and those with pets that tend to bite cables. The KZ ZST cost either 13 or 12 pounds with free shipping (prices from Gearbest), depending if you want a wire with in-line control or without, and you can pick up the Bluetooth Module Upgrade Cord with great battery life (advertised about 8 hours of continuous music playtime, but in my experience it's about 5-6) for the low price of 13 pounds. At 26 pounds total, these headphones drive a hard bargain in the budget Bluetooth headphone space, though if they are to get a larger foothold in the market, they should expand into the western market more.
